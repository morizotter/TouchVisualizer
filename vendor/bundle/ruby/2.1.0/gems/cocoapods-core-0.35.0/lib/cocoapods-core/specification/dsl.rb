    # A specification describes a version of Pod library. It includes details
    # about where the source should be fetched from, what files to use, the
    # build settings to apply, and other general metadata such as its name,
    # version, and description.
    #
    # ---
    #
    # A stub specification file can be generated by the [pod spec
    # create](http://guides.cocoapods.org/terminal/commands.html#pod_spec_create) command.
    #
    # ---
    #
    # The specification DSL provides great flexibility and dynamism. Moreover,
    # the DSL adopts the
    # [convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
    # and thus it can be very simple:
    #
    #     Pod::Spec.new do |spec|
    #       spec.name         = 'Reachability'
    #       spec.version      = '3.1.0'
    #       spec.license      = { :type => 'BSD' }
    #       spec.homepage     = 'https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability'
    #       spec.authors      = { 'Tony Million' => 'tonymillion@gmail.com' }
    #       spec.summary      = 'ARC and GCD Compatible Reachability Class for iOS and OS X.'
    #       spec.source       = { :git => 'https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability.git', :tag => 'v3.1.0' }

      # @!group Root specification
      #
      #   A ‘root’ specification stores the information about the specific
      #   version of a library.
      #
      #   The attributes in this group can only be written to on the ‘root’
      #   specification, **not** on the ‘sub-specifications’.
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   The attributes listed in this group are the only one which are
      #   required by a podspec.
      #
      #   The attributes of the other groups are offered to refine the podspec
      #   and follow a convention over configuration approach.  A root
      #   specification can describe these attributes either directly of
      #   through ‘[sub-specifications](#subspec)’.

      #-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

      # @!method name=(name)

      #   >= iOS 6.0 or OS X >= 10.8:

      #             deployment target in their specifications in order to have

      # Dependencies can specify versions requirements. The use of the optimistic
      # version indicator `~>` is recommended because it provides good
      # control over the version without being too restrictive. For example,
      # `~> 1.0.1` is equivalent to `>= 1.0.1` combined with `< 1.1`. Similarly,
      # `~> 1.0` will match `1.0`, `1.0.1`, `1.1`, but will not upgrade to `2.0`.

      #   File patterns may contain the following wildcard patterns:
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Pattern: *
      #
      #   Matches any file. Can be restricted by other values in the glob.
      #
      #   * `*` will match all files
      #   * `c*` will match all files beginning with `c`
      #   * `*c` will match all files ending with `c`
      #   * `*c*` will match all files that have `c` in them (including at the
      #     beginning or end)
      #
      #   Equivalent to `/.*/x` in regexp.
      #
      #   **Note** this will not match Unix-like hidden files (dotfiles). In
      #   order to include those in the match results, you must use something
      #   like `{*,.*}`.
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Pattern: **
      #
      #   Matches directories recursively.
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Pattern: ?
      #
      #   Matches any one character. Equivalent to `/.{1}/` in regexp.
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Pattern: [set]
      #
      #   Matches any one character in set.
      #
      #   Behaves exactly like character sets in Regexp, including set negation
      #   (`[^a-z]`).
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Pattern: {p,q}
      #
      #   Matches either literal `p` or literal `q`.
      #
      #   Matching literals may be more than one character in length. More than
      #   two literals may be specified.
      #
      #   Equivalent to pattern alternation in regexp.
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Pattern: \
      #
      #   Escapes the next meta-character.
      #
      #   ---
      #
      #   ### Examples

      # @!group Subspecs
      #
      #   A library can specify a dependency on either another library, a
      #   subspec of another library, or a subspec of itself.

      #-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

      # Represents specification for a module of the library.
      #
      # ---
      #
      # Subspecs participate on a dual hierarchy.
      #
      # On one side, a specification automatically inherits as a dependency all
      # it children ‘sub-specifications’ (unless a default subspec is
      # specified).
      #
      # On the other side, a ‘sub-specification’ inherits the value of the
      # attributes of the parents so common values for attributes can be
      # specified in the ancestors.
      #
      # Although it sounds complicated in practice it means that subspecs in
      # general do what you would expect:
      #
      #     pod 'ShareKit', '2.0'
      #
      # Installs ShareKit with all the sharers like `ShareKit/Evernote`,
      # `ShareKit/Facebook`, etc, as they are defined as subspecs.
      #
      #     pod 'ShareKit/Twitter',  '2.0'
      #     pod 'ShareKit/Pinboard', '2.0'
      #
      # Installs ShareKit with only the source files for `ShareKit/Twitter`,
      # `ShareKit/Pinboard`. Note that, in this case, the ‘sub-specifications’
      # to compile need the source files, the dependencies, and the other
      # attributes defined by the root specification. CocoaPods is smart enough
      # to handle any issues arising from duplicate attributes.
      #
      # @example Subspecs with different source files.
      #
      #   subspec "Twitter" do |sp|
      #     sp.source_files = "Classes/Twitter"
      #   end
      #
      #   subspec "Pinboard" do |sp|
      #     sp.source_files = "Classes/Pinboard"
      #   end
      #
      # @example Subspecs referencing dependencies to other subspecs.
      #
      #   Pod::Spec.new do |s|
      #     s.name = 'RestKit'
      #
      #     s.subspec 'Core' do |cs|
      #       cs.dependency 'RestKit/ObjectMapping'
      #       cs.dependency 'RestKit/Network'
      #       cs.dependency 'RestKit/CoreData'
      #     end
      #
      #     s.subspec 'ObjectMapping' do |os|
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # @example Nested subspecs.
      #
      #   Pod::Spec.new do |s|
      #     s.name = 'Root'
      #
      #     s.subspec 'Level_1' do |sp|
      #       sp.subspec 'Level_2' do |ssp|
      #       end
      #     end
      #   end

      #   A Pod should make available the full library by default. Users can
      #   fine tune their dependencies, and exclude unneeded subspecs, once
      #   their requirements are known. Therefore, this attribute is rarely
      #   needed. It is intended to be used to select a default if there are
      #   ‘sub-specifications’ which provide alternative incompatible
      #   implementations, or to exclude modules rarely needed (especially if
      #   they trigger dependencies on other libraries).
